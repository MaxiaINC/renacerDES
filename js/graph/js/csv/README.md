# Deprecation notice
Given the popularity of this plugin, it has been taken in as a Highcharts module since v5.0.11 (2017-05-04), and
development continues in the [official Highcharts repo](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/). This
means it can be loaded from [code.highcharts.com](https://code.highcharts.com/modules/export-data.js) and 
is available with the [Highcharts npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/highcharts). Issues should now
be reported in the [Highcharts repo](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues).
